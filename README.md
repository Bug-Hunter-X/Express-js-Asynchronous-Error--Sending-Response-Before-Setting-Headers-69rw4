# Express.js Asynchronous Error: Sending Response Before Setting Headers

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: sending a response using `res.send()` before necessary headers are set, particularly in asynchronous operations. This can lead to unexpected behavior and errors.

## Bug Description:

The provided `bug.js` file shows an incorrect implementation where `res.send()` is called without proper header handling. This is especially problematic when dealing with asynchronous tasks, where the response might be sent prematurely before the asynchronous operation completes.

## Solution:

The solution in `bugSolution.js` addresses this issue by correctly handling asynchronous operations and ensuring that headers are set before sending the response.  This ensures that the response is properly handled by the client.
